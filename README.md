# math_biology_modeling_project

This repository contains codes for the math biology modeling project (B5.5 Further Mathematical Biology, Michaelmas Term, 2018, Oxford Univeristy).
The modeling topic is Turing models for spatial pattern formation. In this project, we studied the Turing models with two chemical species and Schnakenberg reaction kinetics on 1D and 2D domains. The 1D and 2D Schnakenberg systems were solved numerically and we investigated the influence of domain size and shape on the spatial pattern formation. 

* `plot_dispersion_relationship` plots the disperson relation in the Schnakenberg model 
* `Schnakenberg_model_1D_numerical_solutions` simulates the pattern formation in the 1D Schnakenberg system using the finite element method (Madzvamuse, 2000)
* `Schnakenberg_model_1D_numerical_solutions` simulates the pattern formation in the 2D Schnakenberg system Chebysehv interpolation and `ode15s` (Kristianen, 2008).
